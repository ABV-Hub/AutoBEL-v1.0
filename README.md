# Automated Bayesian Evidential Learning for Geological UQ 

<p> This repository contains the python code of automated BEL for geological model unceratinty quantification using well borehole data.

For illustrative purposes, a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) tutorial is prepared together with the code, using the application to thickness coefficient model as an example. 


#### Installation

To run the Auto-BEL, the following dependencies must be met:
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) 
* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/) 
They can be installed together via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Once installed, jupyter can be started from the command line with

	jupyter notebook

### Runing the tutorial

Download the repository to your PC

1. Start Jupyter notebook,
2. Navigate to the downloaded Auto-BEL master folder, 
3. Open the jupyternote file [Auto-BEL_thickness_coeff.ipynb](https://github.com/sdyinzhen/Auto-BEL/blob/master/Auto-BEL_thickness_coeff.ipynb), and follow the steps in the notebook to run the BEL.
